/**
 * This is an example <code>AttributeFinderModule</code> that looks up
 * attributes based on the context. This kind of functionality is useful
 * if you want to include some information in the Request and then use
 * that information as needed, during policy evaluation, to retrieve other
 * attribute values. In this case, the user's identity is included in
 * the original Request, but the policy needs to know about the user's
 * group memberships. This module looks up the groups based on the user's
 * identity.
 * <p>
 * Because group membership is system-specific the actual retrieval of
 * these values is left out of this module. If you supply this code,
 * however, you can then retrive the values by saying
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;SubjectAttributeDesignator AttributeId="subject-groups"
 *       DataType="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * in your policies.
